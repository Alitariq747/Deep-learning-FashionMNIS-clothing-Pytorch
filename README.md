Notebook contains various  CNN models trained and tested on FashionMNIST clothing dataset


## Deep Learning Project: FashionMNIST Classification
### Overview
 **This project focuses on building and evaluating deep learning models for the classification of grayscale clothing images from the FashionMNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 60,000 28x28 pixel grayscale images of 10 different clothing classes, with an additional 10,000 images for testing.**

## Models Implemented
### Baseline Model:

* Architecture: Simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* Accuracy: Approximately 84% on the test dataset
### TinyVGG Model:

* Architecture: A more refined CNN inspired by the VGGNet architecture
* Accuracy: Improved to nearly 89% on the test dataset
## Tools and Technologies Used
* Python
* PyTorch
* Google Colab

## Results
* The baseline model achieved an accuracy of approximately 84% on the test dataset.
* The TinyVGG model, with a more refined architecture, achieved an improved accuracy of nearly 89%.
## Future Work
* Experiment with different model architectures.
* Explore hyperparameter tuning for improved performance.
* Investigate additional pre-processing techniques.
